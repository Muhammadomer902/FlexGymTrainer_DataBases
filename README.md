# FlexGymTrainer
Gym Trainer made using concepts of DB(Data Bases) in C#(C Sharp) language and Microsoft SQL management studio(SSMS) for the SQL part.
First you have to signup as member or you are given permission as a trainer by admin or directly enter as owner.
A member can tell what he is allergic to so his meal can be recommended accordingly.
He can also tell what body part he want to target on what day so he can get the recommended exercise.
The trainer has the people to train under him for which he makes the schedule.
Admin manages all the operartion.
This Project was made in a group of 3 people and we all worked toghter to make this Gym Trainer.
